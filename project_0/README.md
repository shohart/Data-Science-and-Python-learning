### Project description

Try to guess a number randomly generated by a computer in minimal number of tries.

### Case to solve

We need a program to guess a number in minimal possible cycles.

### Case conditions

- computer randomly generates a number in range from 1 to 100. We need to create an algorytm that can find it by itself.
- algorytm should consider if random found value is less or more than generated in previous step.

### Quality ratings

We need to find a mean value of 1000 tries for algorytm.

### Subject for practice

Quality Python code. Qulity github repo setup. English texting skils.

### Short data summary
