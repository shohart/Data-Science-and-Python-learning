This code defines three functions for identifying and handling outliers in a dataset: 
**outliers_iqr**, **outliers_z_score**, and **uniform_finder**.

The **outliers_iqr** function takes in a dataset (*data*), a feature (*feature*) from the dataset to analyze for outliers, and two optional parameters: *left* and *right*, which specify the number of interquartile ranges (IQRs) to use as the lower and upper bounds for identifying outliers, respectively. The function also takes an optional parameter *log_scale*, which determines whether the values in *feature* should be transformed to the log scale before analysis.

The function first selects the values of *feature* from *data* and applies the log transformation if specified. It then computes the first (lower) and third (upper) quartiles of the values, denoted as 
quartile_1 and quartile_3, respectively, and the interquartile range (IQR) as quartile_3 - 
quartile_1. The lower bound for identifying outliers is then set to quartile_1 - iqr  * *left*, and the upper bound is set to quartile_3 + iqr * *right*. The function then identifies the outliers as the values in *feature* that fall outside of these bounds and returns them as the first output. The function also returns the cleaned dataset, i.e., the original dataset with the identified outliers removed, as the second output.

The **outliers_z_score** function works similarly to **outliers_iqr**, but instead of using quartiles and IQRs, it uses the mean and standard deviation of the values in *feature*
 to identify outliers. The function takes in the same parameters as **outliers_iqr**, with the exception of *left* and *right*, which specify the number of standard deviations to use as the lower and upper bounds for identifying outliers, respectively. As with **outliers_iqr**, the function first selects and optionally transforms the values of *feature* from *data*, computes the mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the values, and sets the lower and upper bounds for identifying outliers as  $\mu$ - *left* * $\sigma$ and $\mu$ + 
*right* * $\sigma$
, respectively. 

It then returns the identified outliers and the cleaned dataset as the first and second outputs, respectively.

The 
**uniform_finder**
 function takes in a dataframe (
*dataframe*
) and an optional parameter 
*thresh*
, which specifies the threshold for identifying low-information *feature*s in the *dataframe*. The function loops through all the columns in 
*dataframe*
 and calculates the relative frequency of the most common value in each column (
top_freq
) and the ratio of unique values to the total number of values in each column (
nunique_ratio
). If 
top_freq
 is greater than 
*thresh*
, the function adds the column to the list of low-information columns and prints a message indicating the percentage of common values. If 
nunique_ratio
 is greater than 
*thresh*
, the function adds the column to the list of low-information columns and prints a message indicating the percentage of unique values. The function returns the list of low-information columns.
